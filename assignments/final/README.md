#TITLE: Wind Tempos, A Music Video
##FIVE INTERCONNECTED ASPECTS:
- Music to Functions
    Each function is queued for a specific point in the song snippet.
- Music to Function pt2
    Sometimes the functions are called randomly, other times I purposefully created functions to have emtional impact.
- Mouse Movement within Functions
    My favorite function is the "light rays" function. In this one, the user can actually move their mouse to get a different view of the the light ray.
- Movement to Color within Functions
    In my "Beach" function called towards the end, color of the rays changes with the movement of the waves ever so slightly.
- Mouse Click to Start
    In order to start my music video, the user must click on the screen to start.

THREE MULTIMEDIA ASPECTS:
- Music
- Images
- Cellular Automata

I'd love for my work to be shared in Don Meyers.
