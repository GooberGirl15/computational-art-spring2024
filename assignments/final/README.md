# TITLE: Wind Tempos, A Music Video
## FIVE INTERCONNECTED ASPECTS:
- Music to Functions
    - Each function is queued for a specific point in the song snippet.
- Music to Function pt2
    - Sometimes the functions are called randomly, other times I purposefully created functions to have emtional impact.
- Mouse Movement within Functions
    - My favorite function is the "light rays" function. In this one, the user can actually move their mouse to get a different view of the the light ray.
- Random Function Caller
    - By calling random functions, I feel like I'm using p5js for what it's made for. My music video will never be the same twice. 
- Mouse Click to Start
    - In order to start my music video, the user must click on the screen to start.

## THREE MULTIMEDIA ASPECTS:
- Music
    The song is called Wind Tempos by Porter Robinson.
- Images
    I used several images throughout including one of Ascii Jesus.
- Cellular Automata
 - I feel like a cellular automata is a distinct type of media seperate from just a drawing function because it creates on it's own.

I'd love for my work to be shared in Don Meyers.
